**BeLeopard** is a technology provider built for creating software solutions for both business and consumer customers.

## What we have done and what we can do

We are able to deliver **cross-platform** applications by using consolidated as well as advanced technologies.
We implemented with Java Spring for the backend, React for the web frontend whereas Swift and Flutter for the mobile. We've knowledge about conmtainerization (Docker, Kubernetes), mobile frameworks (Ionic).
We are currently exploring different **use cases** in order to have an adequate picture of the businesses logic available on the market.

## Why us

By developing these cases, we want to give something **more** than what's commonly offered by these cases. The user experience should be **friendly** for all the platforms for which the application is delivered. The applications we've delivered show how we care about design, usability, responsiveness, data input support and visualization.

## User first

In every software we develop, we enable the user to get in touch with us by sending an email to suggest new features as well as reporting bugs. This because we feel the duty to provide the best experience according to our skills and capabilities with as few compromises as possible. We assure the 24 hours window to solve critical bugs that prevent the application to be usable against its potentials.
