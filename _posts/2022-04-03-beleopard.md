## Hello world

Today is a great day for BeLeopard.

We've just released the **new** website.

During these years, we've used separared sites to promote our apps without having a common reference which communicated the user where they had been born.

**BeLeopard.com** solves this issue by creating a single source of truth everyone can have a look on who we are, what we do and, mainly, _**why**_ we do it.

In BeLeopard.com we commit for **high-quality** products and we want to extend this approach to this website.
This is the first basic version of the application but we're going to introduce several improvements in the future.

Currently, you can navigate through essential sections which will be filled with posts and, hopefully, the new amazing products we're currently working on.

This is the first day of **something**.
