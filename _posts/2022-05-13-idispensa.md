We've done it!
We've just released a new version of iDispensa for iOS after a LOOOONG time.

With this version we introduced a the **Boxes**, as places where you can store the pantries. We propose 4 boxes (Foods, Drinks, Home, Pets) as default ones but you can add as many as you want according to your need!

During this development we have fixed some annoying bugs as well as improving a little bit the UI.

We keep on collecting your suggestions throughout the _Feature request_ feature (which you can find on the **Settings** section) so don't be shy and recommend us something you want to have in iDispensa to improve the app experience!
By the way, we have planned some exciting features to be implemented for the next release so, stay tuned!

You can have a look into **iDispensa** by clicking on this [link](https://beleopard.com//products/idispensa) or just [Download the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/Dispensa/id1519593445) if you haven't done yet!
